## INTRODUCTION
This is a demonstration of how to use [river](https://github.com/scottburch/river-js) to easily create web applications.
Here I will only describe the demo code.  For a better understanding of the river framework please click on the preceeding link.

In order to show off the features of river I have put very small peices of functionality into their own modules.
You can choose to do this or group larger chunks of functionality.
Since I have written much larger applications using river I normally group larger chunks.

## INSTALLING

    git clone git://github.com/scottburch/river-demo.git
    cd river-demo
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Put the code on your favorite web server and load index.html using your favorite browser.

## ONLINE DEMO

Example of removing the 'Add Task' nav button by not loading the createTask module.
This demonstrates how modules can work together to make changes very easy.
